# Amultios

The Continuation Project of Adhoc Multiplayer Online System , or Yet Another PSP Emulator!

### History

Adhoc Multiplayer Online System domain previously is on amultios .net

its a side hobby of reverse engineering PSP Adhoc Module tunneled into IOT Protocol.

The Project Began from Pro Indonesia A Virtual Private Network that build on PPSSPP Forum and continue into a big large community primarly located on SEA Region (South East Asia) its only consist of several people from facebook groups as we started 1 Developer and 3 Gamers.

now the new homebase is located at amultios.world its consist of implementation on Adhoc To Mqtt Protocol but need to be rewritten the old client is modified PPSSPP and PROCFW.

as i now designing the Emulator and Protocol from scratch with this project started the characteristic of Amultios Emulator must persist

```
- Respect Each Amultios Member Beta Tester or Developer
- Build Based on Happiness from community to community
- Noob Friendly (Easy To Use)
- Fast And Performant 
- No Cheat and Save States Play The PSP Game how it should that why i build it on RUST for Memory Safety
- Focus on Adhoc Multiplayer Games
- Keep On The Community Rules and Guidelines No Place for Piracy Dump Your Own Games.
- Only Target Most Device available in Market (Android , Windows , Linux , Osx)
- Gather The Docs Based On Real PSP Device Reverse Engineering Project or things that accurate on information to distract from bias on unknown information
- Target PSP architecture if we can , if not just skip it
- Easy To Build and Maintain
```
  
### RoadMap of Development
Most Of Api Calls of PSP already Documented on rust-psp just need an high level abstraction if we use HLE ways 

But need to simulate hardware on LLE also for better accuracy on HOW PSP Emulated in Host Machine.

Documents PSP Hardware From Various Source

### Hope This Project is usefull for your learning purpose like how i study much from PSP Custom Firmware source code

# Wireless LAN 802.11b

 is a standard for wireless networking and communication. It uses the Ethernet protocol as its underlying data link layer. In order to communicate, devices on the network need to send packets of information, which are composed of various fields, including an Ethernet header.

The Ethernet header contains a number of fields, including the destination and source MAC addresses, as well as the Ethernet opcode. The opcode field specifies the type of Ethernet frame that is being sent. In the case of wireless LAN 802.11b, the following opcodes are defined:

0x0000: Reserved
0x0001: Reserved
0x0002: Reserved
0x0003: Reserved
0x0004: Reserved
0x0005: Reserved
0x0006: Reserved
0x0007: Reserved
0x0008: IEEE 802.3 Length Field
0x0009: IEEE 802.3 Length Field
0x000A: IEEE 802.3 Length Field
0x000B: IEEE 802.3 Length Field
0x000C: Reserved
0x000D: Reserved
0x000E: Reserved
0x000F: Reserved
0x0010: Reserved
0x0011: Reserved
0x0012: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0013: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0014: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0015: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0016: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0017: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging
0x0018-0x05DC: Reserved
0x05DD-0xFFFF: Ethernet II Length Field

In general, the reserved opcodes are not used and should be ignored. The IEEE 802.3 Length Field opcode is used to indicate the length of the Ethernet frame, while the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tagging opcode is used to identify a VLAN tag.

The Ethernet II Length Field opcode is used to indicate the length of the Ethernet frame using the Ethernet II framing format. This framing format is commonly used on Ethernet networks, and includes a type field that indicates the type of protocol being carried in the Ethernet frame.

Overall, the Ethernet opcode field is an important part of the Ethernet header, and is used to identify the type of Ethernet frame being sent. In the case of wireless LAN 802.11b, the opcodes listed above are used to indicate the length of the Ethernet frame and to support VLAN tagging.

# Adhoc Mode

Wireless LAN 802.11b Peer to Peer (P2P) connection, also known as Ad-hoc mode, is a network topology in which wireless devices, such as laptops or smartphones, connect to each other directly without the need for an access point.

To establish a P2P connection between two wireless devices, they must be within the radio range of each other and configured with the same Service Set Identifier (SSID) and wireless security settings, such as the same pre-shared key (PSK) for Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) or WPA2. Once the devices are configured, they can communicate with each other over the wireless medium without the need for a centralized infrastructure.

In a P2P connection, each device acts as a peer and communicates directly with other peers. There is no central point of control, and the devices themselves are responsible for routing and forwarding packets to their intended destinations. This makes P2P connections more resilient and flexible than traditional access point-based networks, as there is no single point of failure or bottleneck.

However, P2P connections have their drawbacks. Since there is no centralized infrastructure, it can be more difficult to manage and secure the network. It is also more challenging to scale the network as the number of peers increases. Additionally, P2P connections have limited range, typically no more than a few hundred feet, depending on the environment.

In summary, Wireless LAN 802.11b Peer to Peer connection is a network topology that allows wireless devices to communicate directly with each other without the need for an access point. It provides a more flexible and resilient network than traditional access point-based networks but comes with its own challenges, including management and security.
